     Spanky the dog is possibly the happiest pupper on planet Earth.
    She is a playful black lab who is 5 years old.
    I'm so lucky to call myself her owner! Spanky makes me feel so happy because whenever she sees me, she always has the most excited look on her face and never fails to show me how much she loves me.
    Although she may get a little too excited every now and then, she is still be most well behaved dog I've ever laid eyes on.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center">
     Spanky is always looking to play.
     No matter who you are, she will play with you until you physically can't throw the stick that, even though she picked it out herself, is twice her size, into the water.
     Speaking of water, Spanky's favorite place to be is at the beach.
     She's such a smart little pup that when I ask her if she wants to go to the beach, she instantly pops up, grabs her tennis ball and runs to the car.
	Although the beach is her favorite place to run around and sniff everything in sight, no matter where she is when her best friend, Luke, comes over, she's content.

		 Being in a completely different region of the country when my precious pup is back home in New York really makes me appreciate my time with her.
		 Coming to this realization has made me think about all of the dogs who are not lucky enough to have a loving family like Spanky's.
		 I think every dog should have a family to love and pet them all the time. For this, I have become a big advocate of adoption.
		 Everyone should be able to experience the unconditional love that is shared by a pet, especially a dog.
		 I have added a link to where you can adopt your very own Spanky and experience the joy of saving your very own dog.
