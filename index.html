  <p style="text-align:center">
     Spanky the dog is possibly the happiest pupper on planet Earth. 
    She is a playful black lab who is 5 years old. 
    I'm so lucky to call myself her owner!
    Although she may get a little too excited every now and then, she is still be most well behaved dog I've ever laid eyes on.

  <p style="text-align:center">
     Spanky is always looking to play.
     No matter who you are, she will play with you until you physically can't throw the stick that, even though she picked it out herself, is twice her size, into the water.
     Speaking of water, Spanky's favorite place to be is at the beach. 
     She's such a smart little pup that when I ask her if she wants to go to the beach, she instantly pops up, grabs her tennis ball and runs to the car.
